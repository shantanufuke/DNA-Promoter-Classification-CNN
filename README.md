## Indrodution

In this project, we have explore the world of bioinformatics by using deep learning. A promoter is a short region of DNA (100–1,000 bp) where transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase begins. It is typically located directly upstream or at the 5′ end of the transcription initiation site. DNA promoters has been proven to be the primary cause of many human diseases, especially diabetes, cancer, or Huntington's disease. Therefore, classifying promoters has become an interesting problem and it has attracted the attention of a lot of researchers in the bioinformatics field. We will try to classify this using Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
